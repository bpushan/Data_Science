# Machine Learning
## Supervised Learning
In supervised learning, the model is trained using labeled data, where each input is paired with the correct output. The goal is to learn a mapping function from inputs to outputs.
#### Types of Supervised Learning:
Classification: Predict discrete labels 
    Example: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines (SVM).
Regression: Predict continuous values
    Example: Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression.

## Unsupervised Learning
In unsupervised learning, the model is trained on unlabeled data. The objective is to identify patterns, structures, or groupings in the data.
#### Types of Unsupervised Learning:
Clustering: Group data into clusters 
    Example: K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, DBSCAN.
Dimensionality Reduction: Reduce data complexity while preserving important information 
    Example: PCA, t-SNE

## Sample Dataset
tmnist dataset is a collection of 26 characters of the English language in different fonts.
So, we have A -> Z in differet fonts.
